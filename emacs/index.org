* Hey, Harshit here

Completely lost my mind while trying to get Computer Science degree at UIC with a surprisingly stable 3.62 GPAâ€”I guess it hasnâ€™t figured out yet that Iâ€™m totally winging it. If I play my cards right (and don't bomb my finals), Iâ€™ll be outta there with a degree in December 2025.

* Current Gigs:

    Teaching Assistant for CS 261: Iâ€™ve got 300 students signed up, but 50 elite ever show up to see if I actually exist. My teaching style? A sprinkle of sarcasm and pretending I know what I am doing.

    Coding Shenanigans at BITS Lab: Iâ€™m whipping up a Visual Studio Code extension that lights up your C codeâ€™s darkest secrets (how u probably GPTed the whole code and dont know how to debug it). Also, Iâ€™m messing with automated proof generationâ€”because, hey, maybe itâ€™ll crash less.

    Technician at Tech Helpdesk : Spending my day asking client if they tried turning it off and on again?

    Officer at [[https://lug.cs.uic.edu/][Linux Users Group at UIC]] where I keep iterating that windows suck even though we use Active Directory ourselves. Hopefully no one ever gets to know that.ðŸ˜­

* Past Gigs

    Human-Computer Interaction Research at UIC Elicit Lab: Iâ€™m basically trying to figure out why people yell at their computers. I thought they were using GNOME but Turns out, a nicer-looking screen makes them yell less. Who knew?

    Learning Assistant for Math : I basically again tried to pretend I know anything in Math.

* Projects I Havenâ€™t Completely Destroyed:

    Unix-like Shell in C: Mostly works like a charm, until it doesnâ€™t and then I remember why I am not a system adminstrator.

    Secure CLI Password Manager: A fancy way to keep passwords that doesnâ€™t involve sticky notes. Itâ€™s built with Python, rocks AES-256 encryption, and doesnâ€™t go through the wash.

    Arc Editor: A slim text editor that can deal with files without blowing up my laptop. Tested it myself during one too many late-night coding sessions

    Tic Tac Toe AI: Crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, itâ€™s designed to make sure I can never win. Great for my ego. Also whenever I feel useless I look at it.

    BlackJack Game: More exciting than my usual lectures and built in old ass JavaFX which whoever uses should have been diagnosed with severe case of psychosis.

  Currently my active website which I built using HTML and CSS is hosted on [[https://justharsh.xyz]]
